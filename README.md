# nearesteneighbors_heatmap
Uses a nearest neighbors algorithm to compute a heat map of ewOBA for the strikezone given pitch type/platoon/count. 

The .csv files only contain terminal pitches so computing Pete Palmer's batting runs statistic by virtue of changing count
is for a different project.

For more information on ewOBA see http://m.mlb.com/glossary/statcast/expected-woba (although the convention is to call it xwOBA;
I will stick with what I've written for now).
